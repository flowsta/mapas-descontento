# mapas-descontento
**Maps of Popular Discontent** is a data-driven journalism project that aims at showing a broad panoramic of the protest in Spain from 1976 to 2015.

We visualize the discontent in two different ways. On one hand we show a map of Spain with the main demonstrations over time and classified by six categories:

1. Health
2. Employment
3. Education
4. Environment
5. Security
6. Housing

On the other hand we provide temporal graphs where the discontent can be seen over time according to the number of attendees to each movement, again classified by categories.

The data was gathered from the tag explorer of the Spanish newspaper El País. To get the information, the tag **Social protests** was selected and then we stored the data through an automatic scraping process.

The system has scraped around 2500 articles including titles, some keywords, place, tags, etc. Information is automatically balanced and organized. With these results, we can create a dynamic javascript visualization that allows the user to explore the discontent in Spain from the coming of democracy.

The team behind this project is: Martin Nadal, Adolfo Antón Bravo y Chema Blanco.
